                    With the modern convenience of automatic car washes, it may be difficult to remember that
                     the industry was not always so high-tech. Though, other commercial car washes came before it,
                      the first semi-automatic car wash in the United States made its debut in 1946, and from there,
                      industry has grown in both size and sophistication.

                    1946
                    The start of the history of car washing dated back into 1914. People used manpower to push or move the
                    rs through stages of the process. Eventually, manual car wash operations peaked at 32 drive-through facil
                    ities in the United States. Prior to this time, the evolution of car washing was just at the beginning, a
                    nd that the automatic car washing was born. The first semi-automatic car wash was active for the first time
                     in Detroit, Michigan using automatic pulley systems and manual brushing.
                    
                    1955
                    Many things had occurred within 1955 regarding car washing history. A businessman named Dan Hanna was 
                    encouraged by the car washers in Detroit, operated his own materials, then eventually made his own car
                     wash called the Rub-a-Dub in Oregon. In 1957, he formed the Hanna Enterprises and eventually reached about
                     1 car washes in America. In 1959, Hanna operated his wash rack until he made the first mechanized car wash
                     ing system. As the news spread throughout the city, so did his business.</p>
